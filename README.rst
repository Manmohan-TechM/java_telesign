TeleSign Web Services: Java SDK
---------------------------------

**TeleSign web services** conform to the `REST Web Service Design Model <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>`_. Services are exposed as URI-addressable resources through the set of *RESTful* procedures in our **TeleSign REST API**.

The **TeleSign Java SDK** is a Java library that provides an interface to `TeleSign web services <https://developer.telesign.com/docs/getting-started-with-the-rest-api>`_. 

Authentication
--------------

**You will need a Customer ID and API Key in order to use TeleSignâ€™s REST API**.  If you are already a customer and need an API Key, you can generate one in `TelePortal <https://teleportal.telesign.com>`_.  If you are not a customer and would like to get an API Key, please contact `support@telesign.com <mailto:support@telesign.com>`_

You supply your credentials to the API by passing them in during class initialization.

  String customer_id = "CUSTOMER_ID_GOES_HERE";
  String secret_key = "SECRECT_KEY_GOES_HERE";
  Verify verify = Verify.init(customer_id, secret_key);

The Java Classes
------------------

With just two classes, **telesign.api** abstracts much of the complexity of the TeleSign REST API.

+------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+ 
| Java Class                   | Description                                                              | 
+==============================+==========================================================================+ 
| com.telesign.phoneid.PhoneId | The **PhoneId** class exposes seven services that each provide           | 
|                              | information about a specified phone number.                              | 
|                              |                                                                          |

|                              |     Retrieves the standard set of details about the specified phone      | 
|                              |     number. This includes the type of phone (for example, land line      | 
|                              |     or mobile), and its approximate geographic location.                 |

|                              |     phone number's "risk level" on a scale from 0 to 1000, so you can    |

|                              |     example, to stop things like chargebacks, identity theft, fraud,     |
|                              |     and spam).                                                           |

| com.telesign.verify.Verify   | The **Verify** class exposes five services for sending users a           | 
|                              | verification token (a three to five-digit number). You can use this      | 
|                              | mechanism to test whether you can reach users at the phone number        | 
|                              | they supplied, or you can have them use the token to authenticate        | 
|                              | themselves with your web application. In addition, this class also       | 
|                              | exposes a service that allows you to confirm the result of the           |

|                              | You can use this verification factor in combination with *username*      | 
|                              | and *password* to provide *two-factor* authentication for higher         |

Java Code Example: To Verify a Call

Here's a basic code example, showing how to make a verify call request.
This also illustrates how to set Https_protocol and restrict ciphers to use.

  String customer_id = "CUSTOMER_ID_GOES_HERE";
  String secret_key = "SECRECT_KEY_GOES_HERE";
  int connect_timeout = 30000;

  String ciphers_to_use = "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256";
  
  VerifyBuilder verifyRequestBuilder = Verify.init(customer_id, secret_key);
  verifyRequestBuilder.connectTimeout(connect_timeout).readTimeout(read_timeout).httpsProtocol(https_protocol_to_use).ciphers(ciphers_to_use);
